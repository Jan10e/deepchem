        "By [Nathan C. Frey](https://ncfrey.github.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nc_frey) and [Bharath Ramsundar](https://rbharath.github.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rbhar90)\n",
        "\n",
        "This DeepChem tutorial introduces the [Atomic Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10603.pdf). We'll see the structure of the `AtomicConvModel` and write a simple program to run Atomic Convolutions.\n",

        "### ACNN Architecture\n",
        "ACNN‚Äôs directly exploit the local three-dimensional structure of molecules to hierarchically learn more complex chemical features by optimizing both the model and featurization simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "The atom type convolution makes use of a neighbor-listed distance matrix to extract features encoding local chemical environments from an input representation (Cartesian atomic coordinates) that does not necessarily contain spatial locality. The following methods are used to build the ACNN architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "- __Distance Matrix__  \n",
        "The distance matrix $R$ is constructed from the Cartesian atomic coordinates $X$. It calculates distances from the distance tensor $D$. The distance matrix construction accepts as input a $(N, 3)$ coordinate matrix $C$. This matrix is ‚Äúneighbor listed‚Äù into a $(N, M)$ matrix $R$.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "    R = tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(D, D), 3)     # D: Distance Tensor\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Atom type convolution**  \n",
        "The output of the atom type convolution is constructed from the distance matrix $R$ and atomic number matrix $Z$. The matrix $R$ is fed into a (1x1) filter with stride 1 and depth of $N_{at}$ , where $N_{at}$ is the number of unique atomic numbers (atom types) present in the molecular system. The atom type convolution kernel is a step function that operates on the neighbor distance matrix $R$.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Radial Pooling layer**  \n",
        "Radial Pooling is basically a dimensionality reduction process that down-samples the output of the atom type convolutions. The reduction process prevents overfitting by providing an abstracted form of representation through feature binning, as well as reducing the number of parameters learned.\n",
        "Mathematically, radial pooling layers pool over tensor slices (receptive fields) of size (1x$M$x1) with stride 1 and a depth of $N_r$, where $N_r$ is the number of desired radial filters and $M$ is the maximum number of neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Atomistic fully connected network**  \n",
        "Atomic Convolution layers are stacked by feeding the flattened ($N$, $N_{at}$ $\\cdot$ $N_r$) output of the radial pooling layer into the atom type convolution operation. Finally, we feed the tensor row-wise (per-atom) into a fully-connected network. The\n",
        "same fully connected weights and biases are used for each atom in a given molecule.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have seen the structural overview of ACNNs, we'll try to get deeper into the model and see how we can train it and what we expect as the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the training, we will use the publicly available PDBbind dataset. In this example, every row reflects a protein-ligand complex and the target is the binding affinity ($K_i$) of the ligand to the protein in the complex.\n",

Here, we've used an 80/10/10 training/validation/test split and achieved similar performance for the training set (0.943). We can see from the performance on the training, validation, and test sets (and from the results in the paper) that the ACNN can learn chemical interactions from small training datasets, but struggles to generalize. Still, it is pretty amazing that we can train an `AtomicConvModel` with only a few lines of code and start predicting binding affinities!  \n",
